## Other languages have "variables"

In many other languages, assigning to a variable puts a value into a box.

```
int a = 1;
```

Box "a" now contains an integer 1.

Assigning another value to the same variable replaces the contents of the box:

```
a = 2;
```

Now box "a" contains an integer 2.

Assigning one variable to another makes a copy of the value and puts it in the new box:

```
int b = a;
```

"b" is a second box, with a copy of integer 2. Box "a" has a separate copy.
