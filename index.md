## Course Info

This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Pythonâ„¢ programming language

    <h2>Reading List</h2>
    <p>On the ocw website the reading and problem sets are all either offsite (Book Chapters) or in a PDF, so I made them into readable HTML files. You can find them listed below.</p>

    <h2>Problem Sets</h2>
    <p>There are only 12 problem sets for this course but they do include some code and handouts with the problem set so I split each one into its own page and laid out the problem with the code needed to include.</p>
